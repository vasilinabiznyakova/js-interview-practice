# JavaScript Interview Practice

This repository contains JavaScript tasks solved as part of technical interview preparation.

## Purpose
- Practice live coding tasks commonly asked in backend / full-stack interviews
- Improve problem-solving and explanation skills
- Refresh core JavaScript concepts

## Scope
- JavaScript fundamentals
- Arrays, objects, strings
- Async / promises
- Common utility functions (e.g. debounce, throttle, groupBy)
- Edge cases and clean solutions

## Format
Each task is implemented as a standalone file and includes:
- problem description
- example input/output
- solution with readable code

The focus is on **clarity, correctness, and explanation**, not on production setup.

## Notes
This repository is intended for interview practice, not as a production project.
